# Problem Statement: RFM Segmentation and Analysis for Customer Behavior

In this project, we aim to analyze customer behavior based on three critical metrics: Recency (R), Frequency (F), and Monetary value (M). Using a given dataset, we will calculate the RFM scores for each customer and categorize them into meaningful segments. The goal is to understand customer engagement and tailor marketing strategies based on the insights gained from this segmentation.  

***Objectives:***

***Calculate RFM scores:***  

Recency (R): Time since the customer's last purchase.  
Frequency (F): Total number of purchases made by the customer in a specific period.  
Monetary value (M): The total money spent by the customer.  
Segment customers based on RFM scores: Each customer will be assigned a score between 1 and 5 for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value, based on the given scales.  
    
***RFM Segment Ranges:***
  
- Champions: Bought recently, buy often, and spend the most.  
- Loyal Customers: Buy regularly and are responsive to promotions.  
- Potential Loyalist: Recent customers with average frequency.  
- Recent Customers: Bought recently, but not often.  
- Promising: Recent shoppers, but haven't spent much.  
- Customers Needing Attention: Above average in recency, frequency, and monetary values but not very recent.  
- About to Sleep: Below average recency and frequency, at risk of being lost.  
- At Risk: Purchased often but a long time ago; need reactivation.  
- Can't Lose Them: Regular purchasers with high frequency and monetary value, need to be retained.  
- Hibernating: Used to purchase frequently but haven't returned in a long time.  
- Visualization of RFM segments:  

***Display the distribution of customers across the different segments using appropriate visualizations.***  

***Conclude findings from RFM analysis:***  

- Provide insights based on the segments.  
- Suggest actionable strategies for each segment to improve customer engagement and retention.
